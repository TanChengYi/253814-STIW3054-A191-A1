   https://github.com/STIW3054-A191/Main-Issues/issues/1
2. Read data from a Github Wiki page. Refer to the link below for the testing purpose.  
   https://github.com/STIW3054-A191/Assignments/wiki/List_of_Student
3. Compare the data and produce the following reports:
   * List all students who have submitted the GitHub account.
   * List all students who have not submitted the GitHub account.
4. Reporting format:
```

|-----|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1   | 243147 | Yao Yangjian                          | https://github.com/abcde    |
| 2   | 245607 | Siti Nur Fatihah Binti Fauzi          | https://github.com/fghij    |
